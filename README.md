# osu! glow

Software for the Wooting UWU that makes the keyboard glow depending on your osu! play!

Requires [gosumemory](https://github.com/l3lackShark/gosumemory) to use.

**Requires changing gosumemory's `config.ini` to have `update = 10`!** Otherwise this barely works.

Change the keys in `keys.txt` as you wish.
